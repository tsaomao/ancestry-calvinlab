For files related to Calvin Lab project, centered around interview transcripts taken and transcribed by Vivian and Sheila Moses.

# Notes
I (Malcolm Gin) am Ning Pon's son, referred to in this collection as PON, though his full name was Ning Gin Pon (our original, pre-immigration surname was every child's middle name in my Dad's generation). I was named after E. Malcolm Thain, referred to in this collection as THAIN. My father worked for Melvin Calvin. As a kid, I met Calvin, and others in this set of interviews, and I heard endlessly about folks like RAPOPORT as well. And the authors of this collection, Vivian Moses, and Sheila Moses.

I inspected the documents pretty carefully for copyright information or licensing. Finding none, I'm publishing these files for public use, historians, and other curious seekers of knowledge and small, but significant histories.

For what it's worth, my father passed away in 2017, at the age of 92. And I think he was among the younger ones from this collection. If any of his ancestors want this taken down, they know how to reach me.
